## Literals

# Primitive Datatypes are of four types

- Interal
  - byte
  - short
  - int
  - long
- Floats
  - float
  - double
- Char
- Boolean

```
public class CWH_04_literals {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         byte age=34;
         char ch='A';
         float f1=5.6f
         double d1=4.66D/d
         long l1=342244444;
         System.out.println(age);
         
    }
}
```

any decimal is not a floating point literal it can be float as well as it can be double as well by default is will be double
literal means the value stored in the variable thats it the type varies

- A constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called as a literal
