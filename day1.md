- Class is just like a blue print

	   public static void main(String[] args){
	   	System.out.println("subham is added");	
	   }
}
class House2 {
	   public static void main(String[] args){
	   	System.out.println("subham is added");	
	   }
}

- JVM is known as Java Virtual Machine which acts as a runtime engine to run the Java applications
- JVM is the one that actually calls the main method present in the Java code 
- JVM is a part of JRE(Java runtime Enviroment) 
- When we compile a .java file .class files with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler 
- This .class file goes into various steps when we run it 
- These steps together describes the whole JVM
