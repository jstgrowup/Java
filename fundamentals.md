## JAVA fundamentals
- JAVA is a case sensetive coding language 
- all the class names , abstract class names interface names and Enum names should follow "PascalNamingConvention"
which means the first letter of every word should be in uppercase
   - Example String,ArrayList , InputStreamReader,StringBuffer,Student
- All Java variables method names should follow camelNamingCOnvention which means the first letter should be in lowercase and the subsequent word should start with UpperCase
   - Example 
     * in , out ,studentName,pageContext
- All java constants variables must be provided in Upper Case letters
   - Example
     * MIN_PRIORITY
# Data types
 1. primitive data types
     - Integers
        * byte
        * short
        * int
        * long
     - Real numbers
        * float
        * double
     - Character
        * char 
     - Boolean
         * bool 
        any number with a decimal point will be considered as double in java not a float (BY DEFAULT)
        
        any non decimal point digit as int by default in java

 2. user defined data types

 # Type casting 
 - The procedure of converting one data type into its equivalent another data is known as typecating
 - Implicit typecasting (upcasting/widening)
   when smaller datatype value into bigger data type
   ```
   int x=10
   long y=x
   ``` 
 - Explicit Typecasting (downcassting)
   int x=10
   byte b=x
